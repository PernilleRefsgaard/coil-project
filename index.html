            <h2>How to play</h2>
            <p>To solve the murder, you must read the story below. Throughout the story, you will be presented with 
                five numbers hidden within the text. Your task is to find these five numbers and then solve the equation. 
                If your answer is correct, the guilty murderer will be revealed, but if you are wrong, you have lost the 
                challenge.</p>

        <h2>The Silent Guest</h2>

    <p>The storm raged outside as six guests gathered in the grand dining hall of Blackwood Tower. The fire crackled, casting flickering shadows on the dark walls. Sir James Blackwood, the host, raised his glass.
        "To old friends and new beginnings," he declared, though his tone carried an unease no one could quite place.</p>

    <h2></h2>

    <p>The guests exchanged wary glances. There was David, the sharp-tongued journalist; Dr. Clara, the quiet but observant physician; Victor, the wealthy art dealer with a reputation for scandal; Alice, James’ ever-dutiful housekeeper; and Carl, his ambitious yet reckless nephew, recently returned from his third stint in prison.The last guest, Henry, 
        sat silently at the far end of the table, his face unreadable.</p>

    <h2></h2>

    <p>Dinner was served, conversation flowed, but tension hung in the air like an unspoken secret. Then, at precisely 10 PM, the lights flickered and died.
        When the lights returned two minutes later, Sir Jaames slumped forward, unmoving. His wine glass lay shattered on the floor, 
        liquid staining the white tablecloth—except it wasn’t wine.</p> 

    <h2></h2>

    <p>Alice screamed. Dr. Clara rushed forward, fingers searching for a pulse. She looked up. "He's dead."
        Gasps filled the room. The front doors had been locked. No one had left. No one had entered.</p>

    <h2></h2>

    <p>Then, David whispered, “It’s Friday the 13th.”
        A chill ran through the group.
        "One of us did this," Alice murmured, her voice steady despite the fear in her eyes.
        Each guest was questioned, their alibis thin, their motives darker than they appeared. The inheritance, a past betrayal, 
        a scandalous affair—every guest had a reason to want Sir James dead.</p>
